I have had an introduction class to Julia, and I know a bit about the reputation of the language, being very efficient with scientific computations. I finally wanted to give it a try.

In this article, I will try to create some basic statistical models with Julia, and to plot them. 

## Simple linear regression

Here, let's try to explain one continuous variable by one continuous variable. 

First, those are the packages we are going to use : 
```{julia}
using Plots
using GLM
```

- The [Plots package](https://docs.juliaplots.org/stable/) seems to be the best package to plot data with Julia. It is a simple interface to several underlying plotting packages, like **gr** or **plotly**. If those names do not ring a bell, they just refer to different plotting packages that have different plotting attributes and characteristics. 

- The [GLM package](https://juliastats.org/GLM.jl/stable/) seems to be the main package for Generalized Linear Models (GLM) with Julia. It will be useful in the computation of our simple and multinomial linear models.

Now, let us generate some data : 

```{julia}
x = range(0, 1, length=10)
#Generate data : 
y = rand(10) .* x

# Check the data :
size(y)
```
The function `rand()` in Julia allows to randomly generate numbers. The default settings of the function make it so that the drawned data are `Float64` between $0$ and $1$. Its argument, set to the value of $10$, indicates the number of random values that are to be drawned. Therefore, `rand(10)` returns a vector of 10 Float64 numbers.

The `.*` function is a vectorized multiplication. In Julia, adding a dot `.` before an operator allows to apply this operation to all the elements of a vector. If we wanted to add $2$ to all the elements of the `a` vector, we should have done `a .+= 2`. The following `=` is just a short way of writing an incrementation, in this sense, `a .*= b` is a shorter syntax of `a = a .* b`.

The other function `size()` is useful to get more information about the type of variable we consider. In our case, it yields `(10,)` because it is a $10$ rows vector. We would get the same. 

Now, let us plot the data we just created : 

```{julia}
plot(
	scatter(x,y, label = "data"),
	title = "Generating Random Data",
	ylabel = "Random variable",
	xlabel = "x",
)
```

The function `plot()` in Julia comes from the Plots package. It is the default plotting function.
The function `scatter()` allows to plot a scatterplot, i.e. independent points that are not linked by a line. If we had not indicated the `scatter()` function, it would have plotted a line between all the points. The `label` value is the one that gets displayed within the box. Specifying "data" allows to avoid the "y1" default value.

It is now time to run a simple linear regression.
I found two simple ways to run this model : 

- Using the GLM package,
- Using the built-in matrix computation function of Julia. 

### GLM package

First, with the GLM package : 

```{julia}
model = lm(@formula(y ~ x), (;y, x))
GLM.coeftable(model)
model
```

Now, if we want to plot our model with the data, we can run : 
```{julia}
coefs = GLM.coef(model)
plot!((x) -> coefs[1] + coefs[2] * x, label="model", 
	title = "Simple linear regression")
```

If we want to include the equation of our linear model in the legend of the plot, we can use the LaTeXStrings.jl package : 

```{julia}
using LaTeXStrings
plot(scatter(x,y, label = false),
	(x) -> coefs[1] + coefs[2] * x, label=latexstring("y=$(coefs[1]) + $(coefs[2]) * x"))
```

And if we want it to be outside the plot : 

```{julia}
plot!(legend=:outerbottom, legendcolumns=1)
```

### Matrix computation

Second, with the built-in matrix computation function : 

```{julia}
X = [ones(length(x)) x] 
(X\y)
```

The first line creates a matrix $X$ such that $X\in\mathbb{R}^{10\times 10}$, with its first columns being only ones, and its second column being the vector of $x$.

The second line does...

### Performance comparison

We see that both approaches yield the same result, but what are the differences between them ? 
Apart from the syntax, we could check the performance of each of them.
In order for us to do that, we are going to use the `@time` function, which returns the time and space used by a chosen function.

:::: {.column-page layout-ncol=2}
::: {.column}
Matrix approach : 
```{julia}
@time begin
	vec_1 = ones(length(x))
	X = transpose([transpose(vec_1);transpose(x)])
	(X\y)
end
```
:::
:::{.column}
GLM approach :
```{julia}
@time begin 
	model = lm(@formula(y ~ x), (;x, y))
	GLM.coef(model)[1:2]
end
```
:::
:::

If we compare the information returned by the `@time` function, we see that the matrix computation approach seems to be slightly faster. However, we have to take into account that the `lm()` function does not only compute the coefficients, but alswo other informations, that are here not displayed, such as the confidence interval, and the probability associated to the t-statistic. In this sense, this comparison does not make justice to the GLM package. We can however remember that if we only wanted the coefficients of such a model, we could prefer the matrix multiplication approach if we need time. 

## Multiple linear regression

Here, let us try to explain one continuous variable by multiple continuous variables.

Again, we first have to generate and plot the data : 

```{julia}
# Generating random data :
x,y,w,z = (rand(10) for _ in 1:4)

# Plotting the data :
plot(scatter(x, y, z, marker_z = w, label="data"))
```

### Rotatable plot

Now, we could continue with the plot function of the default **gr** backend package of `Plots`, but to get rotable 3D plots, we can use the PlotlyJS package.
Since Plot.jl integrates plotly, we could try just adding `plotly()` : 

```{julia}
#| eval: true
# We switch from the gr() to the plotlyjs() backend within Plots :
plotlyjs()
# We plot :
plot(scatter(x, y, z;
		marker_z = w,
		markersize = 2, 
		label = "data", 
		xlabel = "x",
		ylabel = "y", 
		zlabel = "z"))
```
It is now time for some model. 
Let us consider that the variable `z` can be explained linearly by the variables `x` and `y`, and that `w` does not provide supplementary information. 

We are going to use the two methods we saw previously :

```{julia}
# Using GLM : 
@time begin 
	model = lm(@formula(z ~ x + y), (;x, y, z))
	coefs = GLM.coef(model)
	coefs
end
# Using matrix computations :
@time begin
	X = [ones(length(x)) x y]
	X\z
end
```

As before, both results are approximatively the same, with a small advantage for the matrix computation in performance terms. 

### Plotting the multinomial regression 

Now let's try to plot the plane of this regression : 

```{julia}
linear_model(x,y) = coefs[1] .+ coefs[2] * x .+ coefs[3] * y
plot(x,y,linear_model,
	st=:surface,
	label="model",
	xlabel ="x",
	ylabel = "y",
	zlabel = "z")

```

While I did not manage to plot simulatneously the points and the surface on the plot, it seemed a satisfactory result for the moment.
