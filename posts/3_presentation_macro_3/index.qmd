> Article : Junia Howell, James R. Elliott, Damages Done: The Longitudinal Impacts of Natural Hazards on Wealth Inequality in the United States, available [here](https://academic.oup.com/socpro/article-abstract/66/3/448/5074453?redirectedFrom=fulltext).


# Introduction

1 - There exists rising wealth inequality. Economic research tries to explain it by (1) income, (2) differential in Return on Investment (RoI), (3) policies. Without rejecting those approaches, this paper tries to use natural hazard damages to explain wealth inequality. 

2 - The main reasons to care about the effect of natural hazard on wealth inequalities are : 

- its scale : it is very costly.
- its scope : 99,7% of the US counties have been affected by it since 2000.
- its trajectory : with optimistic scenarios, the damages from natural hazards are projected to at least double (or quadruple) in 2050.

3 - Research already showed tha poor people recover less than rich from natural hazard, even in relative terms. Also, research underlines the key role of recovery resources, and not only physical damages received. 

4 - Globally, there is a consensus on this literature about the importance of the relationships between natural hazard and pre-existing social inequalities, and not natural hazards alone. 

5 - They first do a literature review, then perform an empirical study of the different causes of wealth inequalities, with the dataset from : 

- PSID : 1993-2013, individual data. 
- SHELDUS : about natural hazard. 
- FEMA : about federal help against natural hazards. 

## Wealth inequality

6 -

They underly the fact that U.S. wealth inequalities have exploded recently, and define three ways of wealth accumulation : 
1. Wages in the short term.
2. Investment (linked to RoI) in the long term. 
3. Intergenerational transfers at the life term. 
They point out that wealth has major effect on several other variables, such as (1) education performances, education inequalities, (2) physical health, and (3) emotional well-being.
They explain that income and wages have strongly decreased for middle and low wage workes.

7 - About Investment and Long term factors of wealth accumulaition, the authors point out the role of the real estate markets in the increase of inequalities. 

8 - Finally, the differences of interest rates on loans have strongly risen, and play a big role in wealth inequality, especially with the 2008 crisis that affected poor people more strongly. 

9 - Globally, wealth inequality has strongly icnreased at the extremities of the wealth distribution, and policies have also participated to that. 

## Natural Hazard and Wealth Inequality

10 - In this paper, they put the focus on natural hazard with physical damage on property and assets, which can be public or private. Historically, they identify the year of 1755, with the earthbreak in Lisboa, as the begin of the development of an answer from the State. 

11 - In the US, the insurance against natural hazard from the State begins in the early 1800s, with 1803 tariffs to help victimes of fire damages. In 1811 and 1812, lands are freely given to victims of displacement, and in the 1830s, there exists a de facto policy of federal disaster assistance. In 1950, there is the Disaster Relief Act (DRA), that is the main milestone for the n.h. protection policy in the US. It allows for : 
1) Immediate relief (though housing notably)
2) hazard insurance programs
3) rebuilding damaged infrastructure
4) low-interest loans. 

12 - Under other institutions, the authors identify the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), that is responsible for redistribution of money in n.h. cases, and the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), the biggest hazard insurer of the US. Also, there is the private sector of insurance.

13 - The author underline the fact that private and public assistance are focused on restoration of property and wealth, which implies differences in recovery rate and quality in function of the initial wealth of the insured people. Notably, the mention that research has found that poor and non-property owners people are more exposed to risks such as : 
1) job loss
2) Having to move (displacement)
3) Having to pay a higher rent, 
4) Experimenting a decrease in savings. 

14 - They mention the fact that in some natural hazards cases, there is often a reduction or a suspension in labor quality protection policies, and they give the example of regulation suspension after Katrina. 

## Research Design 

15 - The authors then present their research design. They use panel data, to study the effect of NH damage on welath distribution. This effect differs in function of considered population, and vary especially strongly when race, education level, and ownership are considered. 

16 - The paper also inquires about two main hypothesis : 
1) PRivate insurance does not totally prevent increase in wealth inequality from NH damages. 
2) the FEMA aid (in net terms) differs in population and contributes to wealth inequality. 

## Data 

17 - The authors now present the used data. THey begin with the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID), a panel dataset that track US families from a "representative sample" from 1968 to now, with information on county and neighbourhood information.

18 - They also use the Spatial Hazard Events and Losses Database (SHELD), that is maintained by the Hazards and Vulnerability Research Institute (HVRI) since 1960 until now. In this dataset, 18 types of natural hazards and their link with (1) fatalities and (2) property damages, are taken into account. 

19 - They also make use of the Devennial Census Long form for contextualization. 

20 - They finally use the FEMA Projects Summary.

## Measurement 

### Wealth Trajectories

21 - The define Wealth as in the PSID dataset, where it is the sum, at the close family level*, of = 
- Saving accounts, 
- Checking accounts, 
- Real estate holdings, 
- Equity, 
- Vehicles, 
- Farms, 
- Businesses, 
- Stocks, 
- Annuities / IRAs, 
- Minus all reported debts. 

The distribution they get of the wealth is right-skewed, i.e. inflated by the very rich. To work with the data, they : 
1) added a "global minimum" to all raw data, to avoid negative values, and the used the squared root to compress the different wealth levels, 
2) they transformed the data to get a normal distribution. 

![TABLE 1.](Table_1.png)

### Natural Hazard Damages

22 - In the SHELDUS dataset, the natural hazards damages correspond to the "direct damage to (non-crop) property" variable, in dollars. They standardize it to the 2012 U.S. dollar value, and apply the natural log to get the levels of damages. 

### Other Key Variables

23 - The authors underline the fact that some other key variables have to be taken into account. They identify three main dimensions of social stratification : 1) race (4 mutually exclusive categories : white, black, latino (or hispanic), and "other"), 2) education (in number of total years of school completed, and 3) homeowner status (1 or 0).

24 - To get the private insurance investment, they compute the sum of all premium paid for home and car coverage during the interview year. They do not have more data, although it would be better.

25 - To get the Federal Assistance variable, they sum the non fire related FEMA aid. Here the authors detail a bit the aid asking process. First, when a natural hazard is too big to be handled by the county or the state, they ask the federal authorities. If the President declare the existence of a major disaster, the FEMA then takes action and does money transfers and other kinds of help, such as : financial help, temporary housing, house voucher, uninsured personal needs, and even direct replacement of private property sometimes. 

### Control Variables 

They also include several control variables, at three main levels : the individual, the neighhorhood, and the population. 

26 - The individual level variables are : age, foreign birth, marital status, and number of children under 18 years old who are living within the household, and if the individuals have moved in the last two years. 

27 - The variables at the neighborhood level are : the median income of the neighborhood, the number of adults with at least a bachelor degree, and the number of adults currently employed. 

28 - Finally, the variables at the population level are the total population, and the ubran-rural variable from 1 to 9.

## Sampling and Modeling 

29 - Historically, the choice of following the "head of the household" led to only men in the samples, which biased the data from the difference in marital status. 

30 - THe author did run one model per gender in the household, but due to very similar results, they only present the female model with at least four over seven interviews. 

31-32 - Econometrics things.

## Results

32 - The authors first mention the difference in aid against natural hazard damage between 1991-2001 and 2005-2007, showing a clear increase from $237 millions to $1,15 billion. 
Also, they mention that some counties are especially touched by the phenomenon, such as the Linn County, in Iowa. 

### Natural Hazard Damages and Wealth Inequality 

33 - They then refer to Table 2. This table presents several models that try to explain wealth by multiple variables, depending on the model. 
They first talk about the first model, that only takes the level of hazard damage and the year of the regression. 
In the second model, they include all the control variables mentioned previously, and they see clearly that the race variables have a negative impact on wealth. 

![Table 2.1](Table_2_1.png)
![Table 2.2](Table_2_2.png)

34 - In the third model, they also include interaction between hazard and race variables. 
The effects of those interaction effects are strong and significant.
The way to interpret them could be : for a Black person, being affected by a one dollar hazard damage explains a wealth decrease of 12.62 dollars in wealth accumulation from one period to the next one. 
We can see the effect of the race variable in the Panel A.

35 - The authors then test for the effect of education in the next model.
The panel B is a projection of the model that takes into account the education variable. 
In the y-axis, there is "Wealth in 2013".
We can see the three panels of Figure 1 as : for a certain level of natural hazard damage, how much wealthy is a certain subgroup of the population ? 
We see clearly that less educated people are poorer and this wealth inequality is increasing with the amount of natural damage the county went through. 

36 - In the Model 5, they take into consideration the homeownership.
They find that homeowners are richer in zones that are more exposed to natural hazards. 

![Figure 1](Figure_1.png)

37 - Testing all the variables, they find that the ones that cause the biggest wealth gap are race, education, and homeownership (REC).
The way to think about it, is that natural hazards can affect people very differently depending on those three variables. 
In the FIgure 2, they compare the wealth trajectory of an educated white owner and a 10-th grade black renter. 

![Figure 2](Figure_2.png)

38 - Finally, in the last model, model 7, they test for privae insurance. 
First, they find that more private insurance predicts a bigger wealth accumulation, and seems therefore to confirm that it does bring larger payouts due to a better coverage. 
Secondly, including private insurance does not reduce the effect of the other three main factors (race, education, homeownership). 
In this sense, private insurance does not totally prevent wealth inequality increase due to natural hazards.

### FEMA Aid and Wealth Inequality

39 - They now want to test the FEMA aid : Does the FEMA aid differ in function of wealth ? 
In Table 3, they try to explain the FEMA aid by hazard damge, controlling for total population, rurality scale and the year. 
They do find that the effect exists, but is very weak, and not very robust. 
Therefore, they rerun the models (only five this time), but this time including the FEMA aid and private insurance premium. 

![Table 3](Table_3.png)

40 - The main conclusion one can draw from these models is that FEMA aid and wealth inequalities are positively linked. 
Also, Black and Latino people accumulate less when they live in counties that received a lot of FEMA aid. 
The inverse is true for White people. 
The effect can be seen in the Interaction Terms of the Model 1. 
The way to interpret them, is again "being black and living in a county receiving FEMA aid" does affect in [coefficient] your wealth accumulation from one period to another.
In the second model, they take out race interaction terms, but take into account interaction term between FEMA and Education. 
In the third model, they include homeownership.

![Table 4.1](Table_4_1.png)
![Table 4.2](Table_4_2.png)

41 - They also run the models in with interaction effects between the FEMA and othe control variables. 
They find that "the more wealth one has, the more one benefits from living in a county that receives more FEMA aid".

42 - The authors advance that the FEMA aid "polarize wealth along racial, educational, and initial wealth lines, as ecidenced by the statistically significant interaction coefficient".
Then, in Figure 3, they reproduce the Figure 2, but with FEMA Aid in the x-axis. 
The divergence seems even bigger.

![Figure 3](Figure_3.png)

## Conclusion

43 - Wealth inequalities are explained by different elements, and this paper aims to show that natural hazards damages are one of them. 
Also, they undrly the importance of taking into account the interaction between natural hazards damages and pre-existing social dynamics, such as race, education, and ownership.

44 - In that way, they advance that we should think more about the policies managing environmental hazards. 

45 - They recognize that the precise understanding on how natural hazards polarize wealth inequality is still incomplete. 
They thus insist on further research and taking the aid into consideration in the study of wealth inequalities : "equal aid is not equitable aid". 

46 - They advocate for a more important taking into consideration of the interactions between social and environmental dynamics. 
For that, they advance that viewing the U.S. society as an inequal and heterogeneous group would be better in comparison to a monolitic group view. 
THey make a reference to Stalling (2002), and re-underly the fact that natural hazards are more detrimental to socially marginalized groups. 
They therefore advance that the FEMA help should mitigate this phenomenon, contrary to what is happening right now. 

47 - They conclude by saying that the FEMA is necessary, but that we just have to rethink how aid is brought.
